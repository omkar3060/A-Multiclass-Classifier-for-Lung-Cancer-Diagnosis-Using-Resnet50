# A-Multiclass-Classifier-for-Lung-Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-Resnet50
The primary objective of this model is the precise identification and categorization of different lung cancer forms, namely large cell carcinoma(LCC), adenocarcinoma(ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma(SCC). The classifier is trained using a comprehensive dataset of CT scans, providing detailed input for the model. Leveraging the ResNet50 architecture and a robust multiclass classifier, this study achieves an impressive best accuracy of 99.14%.The dataset is present in kaggle.
